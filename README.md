# run-pyspark-in-docker

Just a simple example on how pyspark can be run in docker container.   
Good way for testing spark code, ideas.

## Problem
How to show your pyspark app to others? This way it can be shared with anybody even if they dont have spark running on their local pc.


## Running example
Just docker-compose up the bad boi
```
docker-compose up
```
